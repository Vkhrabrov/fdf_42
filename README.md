# FDF – 42 School Project

## Overview  
**FDF** is a project at **42 School** focused on **computer graphics and 3D visualization** using the **MiniLibX graphics library**. The objective is to create a simple **wireframe model viewer**, rendering a **3D map from a 2D data file** using **perspective and depth transformation techniques**.

## Main Objectives  
- **Parsing 2D map files** – Reading `.fdf` files containing height data for each point in a grid.
- **3D Projection** – Implementing **isometric projection** to render a realistic wireframe representation.
- **Line Drawing Algorithm** – Using **Bresenham's algorithm** to efficiently draw pixel-perfect lines.
- **Dynamic View Manipulation** – Implementing **zoom, rotation, and translation** for better visualization.
- **Color Gradients & Depth Effects** – Enhancing the wireframe with **height-based coloring**.
- **MiniLibX Integration** – Learning how to use a lightweight **graphics library for low-level rendering**.

## Key Learning Outcomes  
✅ Understanding **3D rendering principles** and projection techniques.  
✅ Developing **efficient algorithms** for parsing, drawing, and rendering.  
✅ Mastering **low-level graphics programming** using **MiniLibX**.  
✅ Improving **event handling and user interaction** in a graphical environment.  
✅ Strengthening skills in **C programming**, memory management, and debugging.  

The **FDF project** serves as a **foundational step into computer graphics**, helping students develop an understanding of how **3D rendering engines work** at a lower level.
